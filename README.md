# numwaterfall



```sh
gleam add numwaterfall@1
```
```gleam
import numwaterfall

pub fn main() {
  // TODO: An example of the project in use
}
```

Working on a matrix-like number waterfall for my Linux rice mainly as an excuse to learn gleam,since I like beamvm based languages.

## Development

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
```
